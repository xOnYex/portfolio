Notably, an EF-5 tornado struck Joplin, MO resulting in at least 141 deaths, making it the deadliest single tornado to strike the U.S. since modern tornado record keeping began in 1950.

Billion $ Weather Disasters

Weather Disaster MapThe U.S. has sustained 99 weather-related disasters over the past 31 years in which overall damages/costs reached or exceeded $1 billion. The total normalized losses for the 99 events exceed $725 billion. These statistics were taken from a wide variety of sources and represent, to the best of our ability, the estimated total costs of these events---that is, the costs in terms of dollars and lives that would not have been incurred had the event not taken place.

Common weather events causing billions of dollars of damage are:
•Droughts
•Hurricanes
•Tornadoes

Information on the two most costly disasters for each category of weather event between 2007 - 2011 follows.
